# Complexity 
Complexity of built in Ruby methods were found through benchmark 

### ArrayList#new
\#new uses the same \#new method built into Ruby for the Array class which has a complexity of O(n)

### ArrayList#add 
\#add uses the Ruby built in method \#push which has a complexity of O(1)

### ArrayList#get 
\#get uses the Ruby built in method \#[] which has a complexity of O(1)

### ArrayList#set 
\#set uses the Ruby built in method \#[] which has a complexity of O(1)

### ArrayList#size 
\#size uses the Ruby built in method \#length which has a complexity of O(1)

### ArrayList#insert 
\#insert uses the Ruby built in method \#insert which has a complexity of O(1)
